## Intro

I am a Computer Science graduate from University of Texas at San Antonio currently in my final year. I am currently working at AT&T. I like learning different tools in my free time. I have been part of 3 different internship programs (LinkedIn, Paycom, AT&T). I was part of the ACM UTSA Chapter as the Public Relations Chair.
